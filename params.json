{"name":"Code Club Auckland","tagline":"Making cool stuff with code!","body":"## Welcome to Code Club Auckland.\r\n\r\nHere's our QBasic tutorial!\r\n\r\nQBasic is an old programming language. It's not used much any more, but it used to be the most popular language for beginners.\r\n\r\nOld computer magazines used to include programs written in Basic - not on a disk, but just printed in the magazine. You had to type all the code into your computer before you could run the program!\r\n\r\n### Installing QBasic\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n1. Download [the windows QBasic zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B41zmm_jyDAPZ2hMbzZsQUNiZmc/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n2. Extract the zip file\r\n3. Double-click on qb.bat\r\n\r\nOS X:\r\n1. Download [the OS X QBasic zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B41zmm_jyDAPN3BpNmMwT2x1MWM/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n2. Extract the zip file\r\n3. Double-click on qb.command\r\n\r\nIf you see a blue blocky screen then it's working!\r\n\r\n### Your first program\r\n\r\nWrite this\r\n\r\n```\r\nPRINT \"Hello World\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen press F5 (you might need to press Function + F5 on a laptop).\r\n\r\nYou should see a black screen that says `Hello World`.\r\n\r\n### Asking a question\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 PRINT \"What is your name?\"\r\n2 INPUT name$\r\n3 PRINT \"Welcome, \" + name$\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Making a choice\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 PRINT \"Do you go north or south?\"\r\n2 INPUT choice$\r\n3 IF (choice$ = \"up\") THEN\r\n4  PRINT \"I can see forever!\"\r\n5 END IF\r\n6 IF (choice$ = \"down\") THEN\r\n7   PRINT \"You are hiding in the ground.\"\r\n8 END IF\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Jumping around\r\n\r\nThe computer goes through your program, line by line, as if it was a list of instructions.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 PRINT \"First print this\"\r\n2 PRINT \"Then print this\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if we don't want to go line by line?\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 PRINT \"What's the password?\"\r\n2 INPUT pass$\r\n3 IF (pass$ = \"secret\") THEN\r\n5    GOTO 10\r\n6 END IF\r\n7 PRINT \"That's not the password.\"\r\n8 GOTO 1\r\n10 PRINT \"You win!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Line numbers\r\n\r\nLine numbers are hard to remember so we can use labels instead. This makes your program easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThis program works exactly like the program above, but it uses a label called 'outside' instead of line numbers.\r\n\r\n```\r\noutside:\r\nPRINT \"What's the password?\"\r\nINPUT pass$\r\nIF (pass$ = \"secret\") THEN\r\n   GOTO insde\r\n   END IF\r\nPRINT \"That's not the password.\"\r\nGOTO outside\r\n\r\ninside:\r\nPRINT \"You win!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The challenge\r\n\r\nMake a game where you can move from room to room by choosing where to go.\r\n\r\nMaybe one room has a password door, and the clue is in another room?\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
