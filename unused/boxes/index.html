      <h1>Lots of Boxes</h1>

      <p>We're using JavaScript to make some clickable boxes.</p>

      <h2>What skills do I need?</h2>

      <p>It helps if you know the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>We recommend doing our <a href="/make-a-page/">Make a Page</a> and <a href="/idea-generator/">Idea Generator</a> projects before this one.</p>

      <h2>Part 1: Put boxes on Neocities</h2>

      <p>Download this file to your computer. Right click and choose 'Save Link As…' or 'Download linked file as…'</p>

      <p>Download: <a href="example/boxes.html" target="_blank">boxes.html</a></p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Download the file linked above.</p>
        <p>2. Go to <a href="http://neocities.org" target="_blank">neocities.org</a> and log in (or create a new account)</p>
        <p>3. In Neocities, go to the dashboard.</p>
        <p>4. <em>Upload</em> the boxes.html file from your computer to Neocities.</p>
        <p>5. In Neocities, <em>view</em> boxes.html and make sure it works.</p>
        <p>6. You should see a page with a big empty square outline, and a button that says "add a box".</p>
        <p>7. Try adding some boxes and clicking on them.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now you have your own copy of the boxes program, so you can start improving it.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>From the Neocities dashboard, <em>edit</em> boxes.html.</p>
        <p>I recommend having one browser tab for editing, and one for viewing the page.</p>
        <p>Remember, each time you make a change you need to save (on the editing page) and then refresh (on the viewing page)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Cool, we're ready to make some changes.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: Save one hundred clicks</h2>

      <p>To fill the whole outline with boxes, you need to click the button one hundred times!</p>

      <p>That sounds hard on our wrists, so let's make it automatic.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Look for the line <code>var start = function () {</code> near the end of the file.</p>
        <p>This function gets called when the page loads.</p>
        <p>Right now, it adds one box.</p>
        <p>Use a <em>loop</em> to make it add 100 boxes, by calling addBox() 100 times.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Hint:</p>

      <p>Here's a "for loop":</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  alert("I am so cool, number " + i);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>This loop repeats the code inside the curly brackets 100 times. (Ask a mentor if you want to know exactly what each part means).</p>

      <p>Use this loop, but put addBox() inside it so adds 100 boxes. You better remove the line that says <code>alert</code> or you might regret it!</p>

      <p>CHECK: your page should start with a big black square, made up of 100 little black squares that turn yellow when clicked.</p>

      <h2>Part 3: Flip button</h2>

      <p>We don't need the 'add a box' button any more, so let's change it to a flip button that switches all the boxes at once.</p>

      <p>We have a list called 'boxes' which contains all 100 boxes. They are numbered, starting from 0, up to 99</p>
 
      <p>Here is a function that flips the first three boxes:</p>

<pre><code>var switchAllBoxes = function () {
  var box = boxes[0]; //get first box from the list.
  switchBox(box);

  var anotherBox = boxes[1]; //get second box.
  switchBox(anotherBox);

  var yetAnotherBox = boxes[2]; //here we go again...
  switchBox(yetAnotherBox);
}</code></pre>      

      <p>Add this new function after the addBox function.</p>

      <p>Functions don't do anything until they are <em>called</em>. You need to call the function to see if it works.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Make it so clicking on the button calls the function <code>switchAllBoxes</code> instead of calling <code>addBox</code> like it used to.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clue:</p>

      <p>You need to change a line near the end of the program, that starts with <code>button.addEventListener</code>. You'll replace the word 'addBox' with 'switchAllBoxes'.</p>

      <p>If it works, the button will flip the <em>first three boxes</em> from off to on.</p>

      <h2>What if it's not working?</h2>

      <p>If something's not working, it <em>sometimes</em> helps to look at the error messages. Most web browsers let you do this – ask one of our mentors or try to work it out for yourself. The key words you're looking for are "Developer Tools", "Console", or "JavaScript Console".</p>

      <p>Error messages appear as red words in the console. Clicking on the error message will show you where the problem is in the JavaScript.</p>

      <h2>I want to flip ALL the boxes</h2>

      <p>Right now, our flip button only flips 3 boxes. We want to flip all 100! But we don't want to write 200 lines of code to do it. Let's use a loop.</p>

      <p>Remember our loop code from before?</p>

<pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
  alert("I am so cool, number " + i);
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Use the loop code again, but this time make it call this code 100 times:</p>

<pre><code>var box = boxes[i];
switchBox(box);
</code></pre>

      <p>The loop will repeat 100 types, but each time 'i' has a different value.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Change the function <code>switchAllBoxes</code> to use a loop. Inside the loop, use the switchBox function and switch all the boxes.</p>
      </div>

      <p>CHECK: Clicking the button makes every box switch from black to yellow, or from yellow to black.</p>

      <h2>Tidy up</h2>

      <p>The button still says 'Add a box', which is not what it does any more. Change the label so it says what it actually does.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: Random Button</h2>

      <p>Add a NEW button to the page.</p>

      <p>You'll need to add one line of HTML, to make the button appear on screen.</p>

      <p>You'll need to make the new button have an id which is different from the old button. That's so we can make it do something different.</p>

      <p>You'll need to add two lines of JavaScript to make the button call a function when clicked (otherwise it does nothing).</p>

      <p>See how you go from there.</p>

      <p>Here is a new function for the button to call.</p>

<pre><code>var switchSomeBoxes = function () {
  //count from 0 to 99
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
    var box = boxes[i]; //get box number 'i'
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) switchBox(box);
  }
}</code></pre>  

      <p>Try adding this functions, and make the new button call it.</p>

      <p>If it works, it will create a random jumble of light and dark squares.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>What does this code do?</p>
        <pre><code>if (Math.random() > 0.5)</code></pre>
        <p>Math.random() picks a random number between zero and 1. It chooses decimal numbers, like 0.31 or 0.833 or anything.</p>
        <p>Why did I choose 0.5? What happens if you change it to 0.9? What about 0.1?</p>
      </div>

      <p>That's the end!</p>
