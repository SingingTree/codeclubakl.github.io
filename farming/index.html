      <h1>Farming Game</h1>

      <p>We're using JavaScript to make a farming game.</p>

      <p>In this game, you plant trees, wait for them to grow, then harvest them for money.</p>

      <p>You use the money to buy more trees! So you can make more money! And buy even more trees! IT GOES ON FOREVER</p>

      <h2>What skills do I need?</h2>

      <p>It helps if you know the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>We recommend doing our <a href="/make-a-page/">Make a Page</a> and <a href="/idea-generator/">Idea Generator</a> projects before this one.</p>

      <h2>Part 1: Start a farm on Neocities</h2>

      <p>Download this file to your computer. Right click and choose 'Save Link As…' or 'Download linked file as…'</p>

      <p>Download: <a href="example/farming.html" target="_blank">farming.html</a></p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Download the file linked above.</p>
        <p>2. Go to <a href="http://neocities.org" target="_blank">neocities.org</a> and log in (or create a new account)</p>
        <p>3. In Neocities, go to the dashboard.</p>
        <p>4. <em>Upload</em> the farming.html file from your computer to Neocities.</p>
        <p>5. In Neocities, <em>view</em> farming.html and make sure it works.</p>
        <p>6. You should see a page with a black rectangle. It will turn brown in 2 seconds, then green 2 seconds later.</p>
        <p>7. Once the rectangle is green, click on it. It will turn black again, and you'll get some money.</p>
        <p>8. The button won't work yet.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now you have your own copy of the farming game, so you can start improving it.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>From the Neocities dashboard, <em>edit</em> farming.html.</p>
        <p>I recommend having one browser tab for editing, and one for viewing the page.</p>
        <p>Remember, each time you make a change you need to save (on the editing page) and then refresh (on the viewing page)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Cool, now we're ready to make some changes.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: Draw some plants</h2>

      <p>That black rectangle is supposed to be a plant. Let's draw some pictures of the plant's life cycle:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A small plant</li>
        <li>A medium-sized plant</li>
        <li>A large plant, with delicious apples on it, so the player knows it is ready to harvest.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can use any drawing tool you like. These instructions are for Gifpaint.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Open <a href="http://gifpaint.com/" target="_blank">gifpaint.com</a></p>
        <p>In gifpaint, click 'New GIF' up the top. Set the width to 64, height to 128, and frames to 1.</p>
        <p>When you've finished drawing, click 'Encode GIF' (up the top) then click Download to download the gif file to your computer.</p>
        <p>Once you've downloaded three drawings, rename the files on your computer to "small.gif", "medium.gif" and "large.gif".</p>
        <p>Then upload the files to Neocities.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Part 3: Put the plants in the game</h2>

      <p>We can use CSS to make the plants show up in-game.</p>

      <p>Go back to editing farming.html. Look for the CSS styles. They come after the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, near the start of the file.</p>

      <p>There are some CSS rules called '.apple-tree.small', '.apple-tree.medium' and '.apple-tree.large' which control what the plants look like.</p>

      <p>Right now they set the background-color. You can use an image instead by using a CSS command like this:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url("/small.gif");
</code></pre>

      <p>Get your new plant images showing up in the game.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: Spending</h2>

      <p>Time to spend all that hard-earned money.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Look for a line that says <code>var buyPlant = function() {</code>, near the bottom of the file.</p>
        <p>This function controls what happens when the button is clicked.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Make the "buy an apple tree" button work.</p>

      <p>It should check if you have enough money for a plant.</p>

      <p>If you do, it should subtract that money from your balance, then add a new plant.</p>

      <p>If you don't, it should pop up a message saying "You don't have enough money."</p>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p><code>&gt;=</code> is a symbol that means "greater than, or equal to." It's useful for price checks.</p>

<pre><code>if (age &gt;= 5) {
  alert("You are old enough to go to school.");
  alert("Have fun!");
} else {
  alert("No school for you.");
}
</code></pre>

      <p><code>money</code> is the variable that holds how much money you have.</p>

      <p>If you add or subtract from money, you need to call <code>updateMoneyDisplay()</code> to make the number on screen change. It's not automatic.</p>

<pre><code>money = money + 10; //payday!
updateMoneyDisplay(); //show my new balance
</code></pre>

      <p><code>addPlant("apple-tree")</code> is a function I made that will add a new plant to the farm.</p>

      <p>Good luck with your farm!</p>

      <p>CHECK: You can click the button to add new plants to your farm.</p>

      <p>CHECK: Buying a new plant costs money.</p>

      <p>CHECK: You can't buy a plant unless you have enough money.</p>

      <h2>Part 5: A new kind of plant</h2>

      <p>Add a new kind of plant to the farm. This will take several steps, but you can do it one step at a time.</p>

      <p>Step 1: Add a new button to the HTML. Look for the HTML that makes the first button, and copy it – but you have to <em>change the id</em> so we can give it a different job.</p>

      <p>CHECK that your new button appears on the page.</p>

      <p>The button won't do anything yet.</p>

      <p>Step 2: Find the JavaScript that causes the original button to call a function. (It's two lines, near the bottom.) Copy it and make a new version for your new button. For now, it can just call the same function as the old button.</p>

      <p>(You'll need to change the name of the var from button to button2, or something. And you'll need to give it the id for your new button instead of the old "buy-button".)</p>

      <p>CHECK that your new button works. It should buy an apple tree, just like the old button does.</p>

      <p>Step 3: Make a new function by copying the <code>buyPlant</code> function. Change its name, and change it so instead of calling <code>addPlant("apple-tree")</code> it calls <code>addPlant("something-else")</code> (you choose the something-else).</p>

      <p>This won't work yet – your new plant is invisible so you can't see it.</p>

      <p>Step 4: Add CSS for the new plant. Copy all the CSS that mentions apple-tree and make a new set of CSS for your new plant. Change the size or something so you can tell which is which.</p>

      <p>CHECK that your new button now buys the new plant.</p>

      <p>What's left? Make the new plant different in some way - it could use different images or be a different width and height. It could cost a different amount.</p>
