      <h1>Farming Game</h1>

      <p>We're using JavaScript to make a farming game.</p>

      <p>In this game, you plant trees, wait for them to grow, then harvest them for money.</p>

      <p>You use the money to buy more trees! So you can make more money! And buy even more trees! IT GOES ON FOREVER</p>

      <h2>What skills do I need?</h2>

      <p>It helps if you know the difference between HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>We recommend doing our <a href="/make-a-page/">Make a Page</a> and <a href="/idea-generator/">Idea Generator</a> projects before this one.</p>

      <h2>Part 1: Start a farm on Neocities</h2>

      <p>Download this file to your computer. Right click and choose 'Save Link As…' or 'Download linked file as…'</p>

      <p>Download: <a href="example/farming.html" target="_blank">farming.html</a></p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Download the file linked above.</p>
        <p>2. Go to <a href="http://neocities.org" target="_blank">neocities.org</a> and log in (or create a new account)</p>
        <p>3. In Neocities, go to the dashboard.</p>
        <p>4. <em>Upload</em> the farming.html file from your computer to Neocities.</p>
        <p>5. In Neocities, <em>view</em> farming.html and make sure it works.</p>
        <p>6. You should see a page with a black rectangle. It will turn brown in 2 seconds, then green 2 seconds later.</p>
        <p>7. Once the rectangle is green, click on it. It will turn black again, and you'll get some money.</p>
        <p>8. The button won't work yet.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now you have your own copy of the farming game, so you can start improving it.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>From the Neocities dashboard, <em>edit</em> farming.html.</p>
        <p>I recommend having one browser tab for editing, and one for viewing the page.</p>
        <p>Remember, each time you make a change you need to save (on the editing page) and then refresh (on the viewing page)</p>
      </div>

      <p>Cool, now we're ready to make some changes.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: Draw some plants</h2>

      <p>That black rectangle is supposed to be a plant. Let's draw some pictures of the plant's life cycle:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A small plant</li>
        <li>A medium-sized plant</li>
        <li>A large plant, with delicious apples on it, so the player knows it is ready to harvest.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You can use any drawing tool you like. I suggest <a href="http://gifpaint.com/">gifpaint.com</a>.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>In gifpaint, click 'New GIF' up the top. Set the width to 64, height to 128, and frames to 1.</p>
        <p>When you've finished drawing, click 'Encode GIF' (up the top) then click Download to download the gif file to your computer.</p>
        <p>On your computer, rename to files to something simple like "small.gif", "medium.gif" and "large.gif".</p>
        <p>Then upload the files to Neocities.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Part 3: Put the plants in the game</h2>

      <p>We can use CSS to make the plants show up in-game.</p>

      <p>Go back to editing farming.html. Look for the CSS – it's near the top.</p>

      <p>There are some CSS rules called '.apple-tree.small', '.apple-tree.medium' and '.apple-tree.large' which control what the plants look like.</p>

      <p>Right now they set the background-color. You can use an image instead by using a CSS command like this:</p>

<pre><code>background-image: url("/small.gif");
</code></pre>

      <p>Get your new plant images showing up in the game.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: Spending</h2>

      <p>Time to spend all that hard-earned money.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Look for a line that says <code>var buyPlant = function() {</code>, near the bottom of the file.</p>
        <p>This function controls what happens when the button is clicked.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Make the "buy an apple tree" button work.</p>

      <p>It should check if you have enough money for a plant.</p>

      <p>If you do, it should subtract that money from your balance, then add a new plant.</p>

      <p>If you don't, it should pop up a message saying "You don't have enough money."</p>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p><code>&gt;=</code> is a symbol that means "greater than, or equal to." It's useful for price checks.</p>

<pre><code>if (age &gt;= 5) {
  alert("You are old enough to go to school.");
  alert("Have fun!");
} else {
  alert("No school for you.");
}
</code></pre>

      <p><code>money</code> is the variable that holds how much money you have.</p>

      <p>If you add or subtract from money, you need to call <code>updateMoneyDisplay()</code> to make the number on screen change. It's not automatic.</p>

<pre><code>money = money + 10; //payday!
updateMoneyDisplay(); //show my new balance
</code></pre>

      <p><code>addPlant("apple-tree")</code> is a function I made that will add a new plant to the farm.</p>

      <p>Good luck with your farm!</p>

      <h2>Part 5: things to think about</h2>

      <p>That's the end of this activity, but here are some ideas for extending it.</p>

      <p>Imagine if you wanted to have a new type of plant in the farm. Maybe it costs more, but also gives more money when harvested.</p>

      <p>What would you need to add? A new button, some new images...</p>
