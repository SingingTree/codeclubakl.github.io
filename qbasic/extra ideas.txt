  <p>Take a look at this.</p>
<pre><code>
  coins = 7
  PRINT coins
  PRINT "coins"
  PRINT coins + "coins"
</code></pre>

  <p>What's the difference between <code>coins</code> and <code>"coins"</code>?</p>

  <p>Can you run this code in your brain? See if the computer gets the same result.</p>

<pre><code>
  coins = 7
  PRINT "Do you buy an apple?"
  INPUT a$
  IF (a$ = "yes") THEN coins = coins - 2
  PRINT "You have " + coins + " coins left."
</code></pre>

  <p><code>coins = coins - 2</code> is a strange thing to say! It looks impossible.</p>

  <p>What is means is, the NEW value for coins should be the OLD value of coins minus 2.</p>

  <p>coins = coins - 2<br>
  coins = 7 - 2<br>
  coins = 5</p>

  <p>IF and END IF</p>

<pre><code>
  coins = 7
  PRINT "Do you buy an apple?"
  INPUT a$
  IF (a$ = "yes") THEN
      coins = coins - 2
      PRINT "You bought an apple."
  END IF
  PRINT "You have " + coins + " coins left."
</code></pre>

  <p>Something special happens when THEN is the last word on a line.</p>

  <p>END IF is a strange thing to say. What does it mean?</p>
