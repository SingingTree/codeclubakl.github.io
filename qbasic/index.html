      <h2>QBasic Adventure</h2>

      <p>QBasic is a programming language from the 80s. It's not used much any more, but it used to a very popular language for beginners.</p>

      <p>There was no internet back then. Some magazines would have the code for programs written out. You had to type all the code into your computer before you could run the program!</p>

      <p>It was pretty weird.</p>

      <hr>

      <h3>Installing on Windows</h4>

      <p>1. Download <a href="/qbasic/qbasic-dosbox-win.zip">the windows QBasic zip</a><br>
      2. Extract the zip file<br>
      3. Double-click on qb.bat</p>

      <h3>Installing on OS X</h3>

      <p>1. Download <a href="/qbasic/qbasic-dosbox-mac.zip">the OS X QBasic zip</a><br>
      2. Extract the zip file<br>
      3. Right-click on qb.command and choose 'open'</p>

      <div class="alert warning doNotPrint">
      <!-- fixme: This should be printed, I just wanted to save paper-->
        
        <p>Your Mac might say you cannot run the program because it's from an unidentified developer.</p>

        <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-1.png">

        <p>You can still run it by right-clicking or holding control while you click on it.</p>

        <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-2.png">  

        <p>Choose 'open' from the menu.</p>

        <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-3.png">

        <p>Choose 'open' again.</p>

      </div>

      <h3>Installing on Linux</h3>

      <p>We haven't prepared an easy Linux download.</p>

      <p>You'll have to install DOSBox, download QBasic 4.5, then run DOSBox from the terminal giving it the path to qb.exe.</p>

      <h3>Use QBasic online (for a Chromebook or any computer)</h3>

      <p>Click on this link to use QBasic online:</p>

      <p><a href="/qbasic/online/">QBasic 4.5 Online – http://codeclubakl.github.io/qbasic/online</a></p>

      <p>Our online version has a few problems:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You cannot save your work. The save button won't really save it :(</li>
        <li>The help files are missing, so you can't press F1 to get help on a command.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>However it will let you get started. You could kind-of save your work by taking a screenshot?</p>

      <h3>The QBasic Editor</h3>

      <p>If it's working you will see this:</p>

      <img class="printtiny" src="/qbasic/qbasic.png">

      <h3>
      <a name="your-first-program" class="anchor" href="#your-first-program"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Try it out</h3>

      <p>Write this</p>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Hello!"
</code></pre>

      <p>Then press F5 (you might need to press Function + F5 on a laptop).</p>

      <p>You should see a black screen that says <code>Hello!</code> and then <code>Press any key to continue</code>.</p>

      <p>Press a key to go back to the editor.</p>

      <p><code>CLS</code> means 'clear the screen.'</p>

      <p><code>PRINT</code> writes letters onto the screen.</p>

      <h3>Making an Adventure Game</h3>

      <img class="printtiny" src="forest.jpg">

      <p>We're going to make a text game where the player moves between places by choosing where to go next.</p>

      <p>We need to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Print words to the screen.</li>
        <li>Ask the player to type in their choice.</li>
        <li>Do something different based on their choice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>
      <a name="asking-a-question" class="anchor" href="#asking-a-question"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 1: Asking a question</h3>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
</code></pre>

      <p>Run this program (F5).</p>

      <p>The computer runs the program line-by-line.</p>

      <p>At the INPUT line it stops, and waits for you to type in something and press ENTER.</p>

      <p>It saves your answer into a variable called <code>mychoice$</code>. A variable is like a box that you can put something inside.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: React to the user's choice</h3>

      <p>This is the same code as above, with one line added.</p>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
IF (mychoice$ = "north") THEN PRINT "You found a secret cave!"
</code></pre>

      <p>Try running this program. What happens if you type 'north' [ENTER] as your answer?</p>

      <p>What happens if you write 'North' with a capital letter instead?</p>

      <h3>
      <a name="jumping-around" class="anchor" href="#jumping-around"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 3: Jumping around</h3>

      <p>The computer starts from the first line goes through the program, line by line.</p>

      <p>We can use <code>GOTO</code> to make the computer jump to a different line instead.</p>

      <p>In this example, <code>start:</code> is a label. It doesn't do anything by itself, but you can jump to it. <code>cave:</code> is also a label.</p>

<pre><code>CLS
start:
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
IF (mychoice$ = "north") THEN GOTO cave
PRINT "You can't go that way. Please try again."
GOTO start

cave:
COLOR 15
PRINT "You found a secret cave!"
END
</code></pre>

      <p>Can you run this program in your head?</p>

      <p>Can you add some code so that typing in 'south' makes you go to another location?</p>

      <h3>Step 4: You are in a dark forest…</h3>

      <p>Now you know enough to make a game. You could make:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A game where you move around a forest</li>
        <li>A quiz where you must get the right answer to move on to the next question</li>
        <li>A guidebook where you type in the name of an animal and it gives you animal facts</li>
        <li>…</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Try making something! Remember you can always ask for help.</p>

      <h3>Extra Ideas</h3>

      <p>These are only if you want an extra challenge. Look at these examples and see if you can use these ideas in your project.</p>

<pre><code>PLAY "c d e f g"
</code></pre>

<pre><code>coins = 4
PRINT coins
PRINT "coins"
PRINT "You have " + coins + " dollars"
</code></pre>

<pre><code>coins = 3
IF coins >= 2 THEN
  PRINT "You buy a hat."
  coins = coins - 2
  PRINT "You have $" + coins + " left."
ELSE
  PRINT "You can't afford a hat right now."
END IF
</code></pre>
