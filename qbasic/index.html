<h2>QBasic Project</h2>

<p>QBasic is an old programming language. It's not used much any more, but it used to a very popular language for beginners.</p>

<p>Old computer magazines used to include programs written in Basic - not on a disk, but just printed in the magazine. You had to type all the code into your computer before you could run the program!</p>

<a name="installing-qbasic" class="anchor" href="#installing-qbasic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing QBasic</h3>

<h4>Windows:</h4>

<p>1. Download <a href="/qbasic/qbasic-dosbox-win.zip">the windows QBasic zip</a><br>
2. Extract the zip file<br>
3. Double-click on qb.bat</p>

<h4>OS X:</h4>

<p>1. Download <a href="/qbasic/qbasic-dosbox-mac.zip">the OS X QBasic zip</a><br>
2. Extract the zip file<br>
3. Double-click on qb.command</p>

<div class="alert warning">
  
  <p>Your Mac might say you cannot run the program because it's from an unidentified developer.</p>

  <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-1.png">

  <p>You can still run it by right-clicking or holding control while you click on it.</p>

  <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-2.png">  

  <p>Choose 'open' from the menu.</p>

  <img src="/qbasic/mac-run-3.png">

  <p>Choose 'open' again.</p>

</div>

<h4>Linux</h4>

We haven't prepared an easy Linux download.

You'll have to install DOSBox, download QBasic 4.5, then run DOSBox from the terminal giving it the path to qb.exe.

<h4>Chromebook or other</h4>

<p>Click on this link to use QBasic online:</p>

<p><a href="/qbasic/online/">QBasic 4.5 Online</a></p>

<p>This has a few problems, unfortunately.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You cannot save your work. The save button won't really save it :(</li>
  <li>Sound is a bit strange</li>
  <li>The help files are missing, so you can't press F1 to get help on a command.</li>
</ul>

<p>However it will let you get started. You could kind-of save your work by taking a screenshot?</p>

<h3>Is it working?</h3>

<p>If it's working you will see this:</p>

<img src="/qbasic/qbasic.png">

<h3>
<a name="your-first-program" class="anchor" href="#your-first-program"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Try it out</h3>

<p>Write this</p>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Hello!"
</code></pre>

<p>Then press F5 (you might need to press Function + F5 on a laptop).</p>

<p>You should see a black screen that says <code>Hello!</code> and then <code>Press any key to continue</code>.</p>

<p>Press a key to go back to the editor.</p>

<p><code>CLS</code> means 'clear the screen.'</p>

<p><code>PRINT</code> writes letters onto the screen.</p>

<h3>Making an Adventure Game</h3>

<p>We're going to make a text game where the player moves from room to room by choosing where to go next.</p>

<p>We need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Print words to the screen.</li>
  <li>Ask the player to type in their choice.</li>
  <li>Do something different based on their choice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="asking-a-question" class="anchor" href="#asking-a-question"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asking a question</h3>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
</code></pre>

<p>Run this program (F5).</p>

<p>The computer runs the program line-by-line.</p>

<p>At the INPUT line it stops, and waits for you to type in something and press ENTER.</p>

<p>It saves your answer into a variable called <code>mychoice$</code>. A variable is like a box that you can put something inside.</p>

<h3>
<a name="making-a-choice" class="anchor" href="#making-a-choice"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using the answer to do something</h3>

<p>This is the same code as above, with three lines added.</p>

<pre><code>CLS
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
IF (mychoice$ = "north") THEN PRINT "You walk to Birkenhead."
IF (mychoice$ = "south") THEN PRINT "You walk to Epsom."
PRINT "The end."
</code></pre>

<p>Try running this program and entering 'north' or 'south' as your answer.</p>

<p>What happens if you write something else?</p>

<p>What happens if you write 'North' with a capital letter at the start?</p>

<h3>
<a name="jumping-around" class="anchor" href="#jumping-around"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jumping around</h3>

<p>The computer starts from the first line and does each instruction in order.</p>

<p>We can tell the computer to jump to a different line using a GOTO command.</p>

<p>We add labels for the computer to go to. A label is a word with a colin : at the end.</p>

<pre><code>CLS
home:
PRINT "Should we go north or south?"
INPUT mychoice$
IF (mychoice$ = "north") THEN GOTO birken
IF (mychoice$ = "south") THEN GOTO epsom
PRINT "I don't understand. Please try again."
GOTO home

birken:
PRINT "You swim to Birkenhead."
END

epsom:
PRINT "You fly to Epsom."
END
</code></pre>

<p>Can you see the three labels? Can you run this program in your head?</p>

<h3>You are in a dark forestâ€¦</h3>

<p>That's all you need to know to make a story game.</p>

<p>Or a quiz.</p>

<p>Or a information guide?</p>

<h3>Extra for Experts</h3>

<p>Expand this for some extra ideas:</p>

<details>

  <p>Take a look at this.</p>
  <pre><code>
    coins = 7
    PRINT coins
    PRINT "coins"
    PRINT coins + "coins"
  </code></pre>

  <p>What's the difference between <code>coins</code> and <code>"coins"</code>?</p>

  <p>Can you run this code in your brain? See if the computer gets the same result.</p>

  <pre><code>
    coins = 7
    PRINT "Do you buy an apple?"
    INPUT a$
    IF (a$ = "yes") THEN coins = coins - 2
    PRINT "You have " + coins + " coins left."
  </code></pre>

  <p><code>coins = coins - 2</code> is a strange thing to say! It looks impossible.</p>

  <p>What is means is, the NEW value for coins should be the OLD value of coins minus 2.</p>

  <p>coins = coins - 2<br>
  coins = 7 - 2<br>
  coins = 5</p>

  <p>IF and END IF</p>

  <pre><code>
    coins = 7
    PRINT "Do you buy an apple?"
    INPUT a$
    IF (a$ = "yes") THEN
        coins = coins - 2
        PRINT "You bought an apple."
    END IF
    PRINT "You have " + coins + " coins left."
  </code></pre>

  <p>Something special happens when THEN is the last word on a line.</p>

  <p>END IF is a strange thing to say. What does it mean?</p>
