      <h1>Idea Generator</h1>

      <p>We're using JavaScript to make a TV Series Idea Generator.</p>

      <p>It will help you come up with great ideas for a TV series, like this:</p>

      <p><em>A dance instructor and a rebellious teenager solve mysteries on a tropical island.</em></p>

      <h2>What skills do I need?</h2>

      <p>This activity is for people who've already done some basic HTML and CSS.</p>

      <p>If you've never written HTML, please do this activity instead: <a href="/make-a-page/">Make a Page</a></p>

      <h2>Part 1: Starting from something</h2>

      <p>Sometimes we start from nothing, and write all our own code.</p>

      <p>But most of the time, we save time by using other people's code as a starting point.</p>

      <p>You will need to download this file to your computer. Right click and choose 'Save Link As…' or 'Download linked file as…'</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="example/tvshow.html" target="_blank">tvshow.html</a></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Download the file linked above.</p>
        <p>2. Go to <a href="http://neocities.org" target="_blank">neocities.org</a> and log in (or create a new account)</p>
        <p>3. In Neocities, go to the dashboard.</p>
        <p>4. <em>Upload</em> the tvshow.html file from your computer to Neocities.</p>
        <p>5. In Neocities, <em>view</em> tvshow.html and make sure it works.</p>
        <p>6. You should see a blue page with a 'Next idea' button. Try clicking it.</p>
        <p>7. Try clicking the button lots of times. What is it doing?</p>
      </div>

      <p>Now you have your own copy of the TV show idea generator, and you can make changes to it.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>From the Neocities dashboard, you can <em>edit</em> tvshow.html.</p>
        <p>Find line number 44.</p>
        <p>For now, we are <b>only</b> looking from line 44 to the end.</p>
        <p>Can you see any connection between this code and what happens when you click 'Next idea'?</p>
      </div>

      <p>Cool, now we're ready to make some changes.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: pushing the limits</h2>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Add two new people ideas to the app.</p>
        <p>2. Add two new job ideas to the app.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p>This is the symbol for an empty list: <code>[]</code></p>

      <p>This is the command to add something to a list: <code>push</code></p>

      <p>Remember, you only need to make changes from line 44 to the end.</p>

      <h2>Part 3: Teamwork</h2>

      <p>I like shows that have two main characters.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Make it so when you click the button, it picks <b>two</b> people from the list.</p>
        <p>You should include the words "and a" between the two people.</p>
      </div>

      <p>When it's working it should make ideas like this:</p>

      <p><b>A school teacher and a time traveller who runs a hotel</b></p>

      <p><b>A school teacher and a school teacher who solves mysteries</b></p>

      <p>Clue:</p>

      <p>Look for the word <b>myConcept</b> in 2 lines of code near the end. Take a close look at those two lines, and what happens when you click 'Next idea'.</p>

      <h2>Part 4: New York City</h2>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>We need to say what city the show is set in.</p>
        <p>It should say <b>in New York</b> or <b>in London</b> at the end of each concept.</p>
        <p>1. We will need a list of cities</p>
        <p>2. We need to pick a random city, and display it somehow.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

      <h2>Part 5: Make it pretty</h2>

      <p>Take a break from the JavaScript and improve the CSS.</p>

      <p>Do you remember CSS from our HTML and CSS activity?</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Use CSS to style each part of the app – the button, the h1, and the h2.</p>
        <p>The CSS is near the top of the file. It probably starts on line 8.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Once your generator is looking cool, you're ready to show some people!</p>
