      <h1>Idea Generator</h1>

      <p>We're using JavaScript to make a TV Series Idea Generator.</p>

      <p>It will help you come up with great ideas for a TV series.</p>

      <h2>What skills do I need?</h2>

      <p>This activity is for people who've already done some basic HTML and CSS</p>

      <p>If you've never written HTML, please do this activity instead: <a href="/make-a-page/">Make a Page</a></p>

      <h2>Part 1: Starting from something</h2>

      <p>Sometimes we start from nothing, and write all our own code.</p>

      <p>But most of the time, we save time by using other people's code as a starting point.</p>

      <p>Here is a starting point for you: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/mgatland/deoxy6us/1/" target="_blank">TV Concept Generator</a></p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Open the TV Concept Generator that is linked above.</p>
        <p>2. The blue area is the TV Concept Generator.</p>
        <p>3. Click the 'Next idea' button. Try it lots of times.</p>
        <p>4. Can you explain what the happens when you click 'Next idea'?</p>
      </div>

      <p>The other parts of the page let you edit the app.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>This JSFiddle webpage has 3 white boxes.</p>
        <p>1. Work out which box shows the JavaScript.</p>
        <p>2. In that box, find line number 22 </p>
        <p>3. For now, we are <b>only</b> looking from line 22 to the end.</p>
        <p>4. What's the connection between this code and what happens when you click 'Next idea'?</p>
      </div>

      <p>Cool, now we're ready to make some changes.</p>

      <h2>Part 2: pushing the limits</h2>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>1. Add two new people ideas to the app.</p>
        <p>2. Add two new job ideas to the app.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p>This is the symbol for an empty list: <code>[]</code></p>

      <p>This is the command to add something to a list:: <code>push</code></p>

      <p>Remember, you only need to look from line 22 to the end.</p>

      <h2>Part 3: Teamwork</h2>

      <p>I like shows that have two main characters.</p>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>Make it so when you click the button, it picks <b>two</b> people from the list.</p>
        <p>You should include the words "and a" between the two people.</p>
      </div>

      <p>When it's working it should make ideas like this:</p>

      <p><b>A school teacher and a time traveller who runs a hotel</b></p>

      <p><b>A school teacher and a school teacher who solves mysteries</b></p>

      <p>(Can you spot and fix the grammatical mistakes?)</p>

      <h2>Part 4: New York City</h2>

      <div class="alert">
        <p>We need to say what city the show is set in.</p>
        <p>It should say <b>in New York</b> or <b>in London</b> at the end of each concept.</p>
        <p>1. We will need a list of cities</p>
        <p>2. We need to pick a random city, and display it somehow.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Clues:</p>

      <p>nope</p>

      <h2>Part 5: Make it pretty</h2>

      <p>Take a break from the JavaScript and improve the CSS.</p>

      <p>Do you remember how CSS works?</p>

      <h2>Extra Activity</h2>

      <p>We are working on a website called JSFiddle. JSFiddle is just for coders like us. If you want to show your app to other people, you don't want to have all the code right up there!</p>

      <p>You can put your program on Neocities instead.</p>

      <p>You will need to download these three files to your computer. Right click and choose 'Download As...' or 'Save Target As...'</p>

      <p><a href="example/tvshow.html">tvshow.html</a></p>
      <p><a href="example/script.js">script.js</a></p>
      <p><a href="example/style.css">style.css</a></p>

      <p>Then log into Neocities and upload them.</p>

      <p>Now open the files for editing and copy your changes and improvements into the JavaScript and CSS files.</p>

      <p>(Note that our HTML file is longer than the HTML was in JSFiddle. That's because JSFiddle was doing some of the work for us automatically, but on Neocities we have to do everything ourselves.)</p>
